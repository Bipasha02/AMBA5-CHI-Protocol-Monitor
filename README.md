# AMBA5-CHI-Protocol-Monitor

The CHI architecture provides a comprehensive layered specification to build small, medium, and large systems consisting of multiple components using a scalable coherent hub interface and on-chip interconnect. The CHI architecture permits flexibility on the topology of the component connections, which can be driven from the system performance, power and area requirements.
The components of CHI based systems can comprise of standalone processors, processor clusters, graphic processors, memory controllers, I/O bridges, PCIe subsystems and the interconnect itself.


‚óè The project is about creating a monitor that is to be attached to all CHI interfaces in the design in order to analyse different transactions in AMBA 5 - CHI (Coherent Hub Interface) Protocol, which is designed to maintain performance in systems with a growing number of components and users.
